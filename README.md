# Basic info
I live in Minas Gerais, Brasil and I speak:  
- Portuguese: Native (Brazilian).
- English: B2, fluent (mostly with american-like accent).
- German: B1, not fluent.

I use functional programming to make multithreading easy.  
I use LUKS, LVM, BTrFS and ZRAM to make an OS install reliable, performant and secure. Sometimes also a LUKS detached header and a separate boot partition in a flash drive if things are serious.  
When writing documentation, I imagine the reader is as smart as a donkey. It's up to you whether that's a pro or con.  
I love to learn new languages (programming or not).
